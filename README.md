## Credits

People I got ideas from:

* [re-xyr](https://github.com/re-xyr) for the minimal home page design, using Iosevka as the monospace font
* [NotNite](https://github.com/NotNite) for the commit <> at <> with <> section in the footer
* [lilysoftpaws](https://github.com/lilysoftpaws) for the up/down/enter navigation on the contact page
* [KokeCacao](https://github.com/KokeCacao) for having user-submitted notes on the home page
